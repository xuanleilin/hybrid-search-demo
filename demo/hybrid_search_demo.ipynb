''\\\\nRegarding the song 's meaning , O'Brien told The Sun it , `` is a sort of ode to meaninglessness , that absolute void that we all feel at some stage in our lives , if not every single day .\\\\nIt sort of proposes that this void is the very thing that binds us all together as human beings on this planet . ''\\\\nO'Brien described this song to The Sun , as a `` tragi-comedy .

''\\\\n-LRB- Both song titles taken from a recurring line in the book used every time a death occurs -RRB- Also English alternative rock band Billy Pilgrim took their name from the novel 's soldier protagonist .\\\\nThis was the only song on -LRB- Awayland -RRB- that was written by O'Brien in one session .\\\\nHe explained to WhiteTapes : `` I literally woke up and it was in my head .\\\\nLike a Paul McCartney moment .\\\\nThis never happened to me before or after .\\\\nI just sang it to my computer and recorded so that was a quick song .\\\\nThe others were very long and slow and just , really teasing .

''\\\\nHenderson has spoken before about his pre-music gigs , and one ca n't help but wonder if , at some point along that path , he was driven to take his own advice after the droning 9-5 world .\\\\n`` I was more or less a butler/personal assistant to a lawyer in Hartford .\\\\nWe do n't have enough time in the day to talk about that job -- it was interesting working with a very quirky gentleman .

      "Description: TFK frontman/songwriter Trevor McNevan had the idea for this song for some time .\\nHe told NewReleaseTuesday : `` Although it 's in the same vein as some of our other high-octane songs , like ` Fire It Up , ' it 's quite different .\\nI wanted it to have that U2 Vertigo type vibe ; that big stadium energy with single notes on the main guitar riff , instead of chords . ''\\nThis was a challenge for McNevan to sing as its one of the highest songs vocally he 's written to date .\\nHe told NewReleaseTuesday : `` With every record , you try to push yourself .\\nWhen your writing it 's no big deal , but when you get tracking , you realize , ` wow , I 'm gon na really have to step into this ! '\\nAnd this was the first song written for the new album that had actual rhyming in it .\\nI grew up on old school hip hop and have always been into rhyming .\\nThat 's where I came from , and I think it has given me a lot of unique advantages as a vocalist and as a writer .\\nIt also has its setbacks .\\nYou have to remember that not everybody is listening for a clever or witty lyric or vocal pattern , and it can easily throw them off or sometimes just go right over their heads .\\nI hate predictable rhymes .\\nThis song is like an explosive ; it builds and then explodes , comes right back down , builds , and then explodes again .\\nMusical pyro !!! I wanted the listener to feel the energy , and feel the emotion behind it .\\nIt 's a call to action . ''\n",

      "Description: Lead singer Christian Lindskog : `` This was a possible title for the record for me .\\nIt was one of the first things I wrote and was very much tied to the intro piece .\\nDuring my time in Africa I dealt with a lot of conflict about my feelings towards what I was seeing .\\nThere is so much devastation it is hard not to become numb to it and just shut down .\\nWhen I came home I found the same thing was really true for everything we have to deal with from our TV sets .\\nI had n't seen any TV for 6 weeks and when I turned it back on I was so shocked by what I was seeing and I realized we become numb to the things that come out of our TV everyday .\\nThe lyric was actually pretty much improvised in the studio .\\nIt was one of the first vocals I did .\\nWith every record we make it seems like I never have the lyrics ready until the last minute , and sometime not even then !\\nSo I ended up working on things at the mic .\\nThis was definitely one of those .\\nThe idea of the frost in the grass is one I really love .\\nIt always looks so beautiful when you see a field covered in frost .\\nI want to take my shoes off and run in it , but the reality is , ITS COLD .\\nAnd eventually its not just your feet that are cold , but your whole body .\\nPeople 's hearts are slowly becoming colder , emotions are being replaced , we want to escape from ourselves .\\nWe are on a treadmill of performance but performance without purpose .\\nYou can blame society but we are society .\\nEventually what is in your heart makes you take a stand .\\nDrummer Marcus Dahlstrom : `` I have kind of a thing on the side writing electronic music .\\nI love it .\\nI have a lot of music like this and Simon heard this one track I was working on and thought we should turn it into a Blindside song .\\nI was a little unsure about how we would make it work but he found a way to translate the riff to the guitar .\\nSo I started to play what I had programmed and we ended up with the basic structure of the song .\\nWe experimented with this track a lot .\\nFrom this original idea to convert an electronic track to something more organic .\\nOne night Lasse and I were in the studio fooling around with some delays to spice the song up a bit and we ended up with a very strange layering of delays .\\nWe played around with some EQ and ended up with a very atmospheric piece that sounded nothing like the original song .\\nThat actually turned into the basis for music beneath the intro .\\nThen Simon and Christian did there thing and then we had the intro !\\nI also played a second drum part at half speed on the end of this song and then we doubled it to bring it up to tempo .\\nIt is the high sound you hear on the final chorus .\\nA lot of people think it is programming , but it is all live drums .

''\\nJennifer Nettles told CMT News that she embraced the chance to write lyrics based on the dub rhythm of the actual words .\\n`` The lyrics themselves can just be fun words that sound really ` riki-tiki ' to say , '' she noted .\\n`` It does n't have to always have to make narrative sense but just have fun with having fun words .\\nIf you remember the Sugar Hill Gang -LSB- a pioneering hip hop group in the '70s check out Rapper 's Delight -RSB- , when everybody wanted to learn ` hip-hop-hippa-to-the-hippity-hip-hop . '\\nEverybody wants to learn that .\\nIt 's fun to say . ''\n",

      " Description: Brooklyn quintet Friends may be a Pop band , but their lyrical content is more thoughtful than many others in their genre .\\n`` One thing that I think is really cool is to create a sense of joy and empowerment , '' said Samantha Urbani to The Independent .\\n`` But not just with a message of jubilant positivity - we have a song about death and anticipating it called ` Ideas on Ghosts , ' but it 's a dance song so you reach this level of cathartic movement and energised dancing , but with a sense of awareness of all the negativity and all of the sadness and all of the spectrum of human feelings .\\nI think it 's really cool because a lot of dance songs are just sexy come-ons .\\nThis is thinking persons ' pop music , I hope .

      " Description: According to vocalist/guitarist James Petralli , White Denim 's songs are the musical manifestations of abstract paintings or philosophical tracts .\\nHe explained to UK music magazine the NME : `` The things that I like to read are generally abstract .\\nI like patterns , I like reading poetry and avant-garde prose and I 'm more interested in musical patterns in literature than I am in long-form narratives .\\nI look at paintings and try to visualise an object or image , then assimilate how that makes me feel into a series of phrases and try to make it musical . ''\\nPetralli told the NME the song is about , `` creating work and weighing its importance . ''\\nThis meditative hoedown is loosely based on some excerpts from The Blue and Brown Books by Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein .\\nPetralli told the NME : `` The lyric-writing process is like an excavation , I 'm trying to pull words and melodies out of what 's already there . ''\\nPetralli 's father is former Major League Baseball catcher Geno Petralli , whose career spanned 12 years , from 1982 to 1993 .\n",

      " Description: The Court Yard Hounds album spans sounds of folk , country , rock and Americana , and on this song about an angry , disapproving father , the sisters rock out .\\nThe Boot asked Martie Maguire if was there any concern about the genre that the music would fit into .\\nShe replied : `` Not really , because Emily was doing her own demos and she would give the songs to me and they were basically complete .\\nSome of them were guitar-vocal , but some of them had a Dobro part or had a garage-band drum loop , just to kind of get her idea across .\\nSo it was all in her head , and when I got them it was actually hard to add a full band to them because I was so married to the demos .\\nEmily does n't really write with a genre in mind , she writes with an idea or a melody , and that drives it .\\nI 'm the same kind of songwriter .\\n-LSB- I do n't say -RSB- ` I 'm gon na sit down and write a rock song ' or ` I 'm gon na sit down a write a country song . '\\nWe have a bluegrass background and that tends to seep into things , the kind of acoustic nature of things -LSB- on songs like -RSB- ` Ai n't No Son ' and ` The Coast , ' the very dry acoustic sound comes from our love of liking the natural sound of instruments .\\nIt 's not a very affected sound .\\nThat sometimes can lean more country or more acoustic , but ... when we put an electric guitar in there , that would take it in a rock direction .\\nI think Rolling Stone called it ` folk-rock , ' which I thought was an interesting categorization . ''\\nLyrically the song is an angry argument between a father and a son who 's revealed he is gay .\\nRobison was originally inspired to write the song after watching a documentary on children coming out.Maguire told the Australian newspaper Star Observer : `` We wrote it after Emily had watched a documentary about families who throw their young boys out of the house when they find out they 're gay .\\nShe was really disturbed by that mentality .\\nShe does n't like having to sing it from the father 's perspective , because she really has to become that person when she 's singing it .

      " Description: This brooding song features the lyric , `` I believe in God . ''\\nSpeaking with The Sun , Cave put his apparent statement of faith into context into context .\\n`` I 'm talking about believing in God , believing in mermaids and believing in 72 virgins , '' he said .\\n`` The song starts reeling off the options and I think what I 'm really saying is I believe in the idea of believing in things.The fact that we humans have that capacity or need to believe is not a shameful thing as some people might see it , but hugely endearing . ''\\nCave also references an incident in December 2010 when he crashed his Jaguar car into a speed camera .\\n`` I do driver alertness course , '' he intones in his baritone croon .\\nThe singer and his twin sons all walked away from the accident unharmed , but Cave had to attend a driver alertness course as a punishment .\\n`` I rather liked it , '' he told The Sun .\\n`` Because it was really rehab for drivers and there was that kind of shameful look about the people there .

''\\nRegarding the meaning of this life-affirming song , Cave told The Sun : `` We all have this feeling of the world folding in on us .\\nWhether it 's environmental , the economy , nuclear or whatever , I do n't think there 's anyone on the planet who 's walking around thinking things are okay .\\n`` So to me , there 's this idea that we need to carry on and do what we do .\\nThe song is optimistic in that respect .\\nOf course it 's impossible to push the sky away but we need to try . ''\\nThe Push The Sky Away album debuted at # 1 in a number of countries including Australia , Austria , Belgium , Holland , New Zealand and Portugal .\\nThe Bad Seeds also scored their highest chart placing in the U.S. after the record landed at # 29 on the Billboard 200 .\\nThe album 's cover image shows Cave opening one of his bedroom Georgian window shutters to illuminate his naked wife , model Susie Bick .\\nSpeaking with The Guardian , Cave was at pains to point out the picture was n't his idea .\\nHe explained that he walked in on his wife 's photoshoot for a French magazine just as photographer Dominique Issermann happened to press the shutter button : `` I was more reluctant to use it than she was , to be honest , '' he said .\\nThe song features a children 's choir from the French school not far from the La Fabrique studio .\\nCave told The Sun : `` None of them could speak a word of English and did all the singing phonetically but they gave the whole thing a very beautiful , eerie feel .
